Mike Horvath's LDraw models and scenes.

There are five folders:

* inlined - created using the "library level" extraction tool of MPDCenter
* povray - models and scenes in POV-Ray format
* regular - the latest versions of my models in LDR and MPD format
* renders - rendered images created using POV-Ray
* superinlined - created using the "lowest level" extraction tool of MPDCenter
