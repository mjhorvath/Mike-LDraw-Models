Mike Horvath's LDraw models and scenes.

There are four folders:

* boxed - contains "boxed" versions of models created using [LDraw Boxer](https://github.com/Jeremy1980/LDBoxer)
* gallery - rendered images created using [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) or other software. See the [gallery page](https://mjhorvath.github.io/Mike-LDraw-Models/gallery/gallery.html).
* inlined - created using the "library level" extraction tool of [MPDCenter](https://ldraw.heidemann.org/index.php?page=mpdcenter)
* povray - models and scenes in [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) format
* source - the original versions of my models in MPD format

There was originally a sixth folder for what I call "superinlined" models created using the "lowest level" extraction tool of [MPDCenter](https://ldraw.heidemann.org/index.php?page=mpdcenter), but the files were too large to upload to GitHub.

Povray files prefixed with "wrapper" are the top level files that should be rendered. All other povray files are transcluded into them.
